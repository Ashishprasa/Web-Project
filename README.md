# Simple Static Web Page Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Static Web Page project! This project is an exploration of basic web development using HTML and CSS. The goal is to create a straightforward static web page with a focus on establishing a clean and appealing user interface.

As the project evolves, the intention is to expand its functionality and interactivity by incorporating JavaScript and its framework in the future. This will enhance the user experience and introduce dynamic elements to the web page.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file where the structure of the web page is defined.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling and layout.
